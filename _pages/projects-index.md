Here you'll find a comprehensive list of articles I've written, circuits designed and maybe some other stuff.

## Articles

-   [Log Pots For All](/articles/log-pots/) - an interactive tool for building your own log and anti-log pots using linear pots and
    loading resistors.
-   [Add Libraries To OrCad Capture](/articles/pspice-lib/) - having trouble installing or simulating `pspice` libraries? Maybe this will help.
