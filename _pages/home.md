Hi! I'm an Electronic Engineer that loves everything audio and this is my personal site where I upload my projects. I've been designing and building my own circuits for a while now, and you can check them [here](/projects/). I'm also a musician (piano/synth/keyboards in general) having worked and recorded with some wonderful people, you can read about it [here](/experience/#music). Before focusing on my circuits, I worked as a Data Scientist for a while developing mainly in R/Shiny, more about it [here](/experience/#work-experience). I also graduated in Mathematics :grin: and do some private tutoring for School and University students.
