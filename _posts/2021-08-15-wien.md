A variable Wien Bridge Oscillator, including an output stage. I built this one beacuse I needed a decent(ish) sinusoidal generator for testing. Distortion is not great, as it uses simple diode stabilisation. I ended up using dual LDR's, as getting dual-ganged potentiometers is not very easy here (plus, much more expensive - even if you take the led driver circuit components into account).
